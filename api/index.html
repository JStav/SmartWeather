<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This API gives access to observation and metadata for WeatherFlow Smart Weather Stations. You can learn more about WeatherFlow Smart Weather at <a href="http://www.weatherflow.com/smart-home-weather-stations/">http://www.weatherflow.com/smart-home-weather-stations/</a> . To see an example of what you can do with this API visit <a href="http://smartweather.weatherflow.com">http://smartweather.weatherflow.com</a></p>

<h2>Object Model</h2>
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/swd_object_model.jpg" alt="WeatherFlow Smart Weather API Object Model" style="width:100%" />

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Smart Weather Station users have the option of setting the data for each of their stations as either public or private. The API has two access levels (Public and User).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Public Access Level with API Key
		<ul>
			<li>Access to all Stations currently set as "public"</li>
			<li>Send your API Key as "api_key" in the query string with all API requests</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>User Access Level with Oauth2 Access Token
		<ul>
			<li>Access to all data owned by the user's access token</li>
			<li>Access to all Stations currently set as "public"</li>
			<li>Send the access token as "token" in the query string with all API requests</li>
			<li>Oauth2 Implicit Flow
				<ul>
					<li>Use this flow to get an access token that never expires. This is the token you send with all API requests.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Contact Us to get your API Key or Oauth2 Client
		<ul>
			<li>You can use this development API key to get started quickly. Do not use this key in your application.</li>
			<li>Dev API Key = 20c70eae-e62f-4d3b-b3a4-8586e90f3ac8</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Use the API Endpoints section below to test the API.
		<ul>
			<li>Use the "Authorization" button to either enter your API Key or use the Oauth2 path to connect to your Smart Weather user account.
				<ul>
					<li>If you do not do this step the API will respond with "401 Unauthorized"</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Find a station_id (this is the id of your Station). The easiest way to do this is sign into you Smart Weather account using a browser and go to an observation list view for a Station. Your should see a URL that includes a location_id that looks something like this.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/station/690">https://smartweather.weatherflow.com/station/690</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Try the stations service using the station_id. The response should contain all of the meta data for the Station. Make note of a device_id so you can use it later to get observations.</li>
			<li>Try the observations service using just the device_id. If you only send the device_id in the request you should see the latest observation in the response.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
